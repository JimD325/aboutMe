<section>Hello! My name is Jim Doyle, and welcome to my about me page! My goal is that when you are done reading this page you will have a better idea of who I am, where I've been, and where I hope to go. </section>

            <h2>Where I've Been</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Renton Washington. While I currently live on the east side of the state, I come back to the west side on a regular basis to catch up with family and the friends that I grew up with. I've lived all over Washington State, in southern California, New Jersey, and Washington DC. </p>

            <h2>Education History</h2>
            <p>I graduated from Washingto State University with a degree in Chemical Engineering. While I am very proud of my academic achievements there, I knew with about a year left of schooling that particular line of work would not be for me. </p>

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>I have worn several hats in my my life. I served in the United States Marine Corps for four years, and like many of my fellow veterans found the experience to be the most formative of my life. Immediately after the Marine Corps I began going to school, and while taking classes spent time working at a hospital in Seattle. I eventually moved to begin taking classes for my major at WSU, and since I graduated have been working as a process engineer in the paper industry.   </p>

            <h2>Plans for  the Future</h2>
            <p>Moving forward, I am looking to pivot from the pulp and paper industry to the tech industry. As far as not professional goals, a long time goal of mine has been to hike the Pacific Crest Trail. </p>
